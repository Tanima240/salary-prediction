# 💼 Salary Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning model that predicts salaries based on years of experience using **Linear Regression**. It’s a beginner-friendly example of supervised learning with data visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains 20 records with the following columns:
- `YearsExperience`: Number of years of professional experience
- `Salary`: Annual salary in USD

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Import Libraries** – Load essential Python libraries for data analysis and machine learning.
2. **Load Dataset** – Read the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
3. **EDA & Visualization** – Explore the data using summary statistics and visualizations.
4. **Correlation Analysis** – Understand the relationship between experience and salary.
5. **Model Building** – Train a linear regression model using scikit-learn.
6. **Model Testing** – Evaluate the model using R² score and Mean Squared Error.
7. **Predictions** – Predict salaries for new experience values and visualize the regression line.

## 📈 Sample Output

- R² Score: *e.g., 0.95*
- MSE: *e.g., 1200000*

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
